### Saying Sorry and the Appropriate Way to Respond
- **I've got some bad news** about the bike you lent me..
- What's that?
- I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry.
- **Don't worry about it**. It's not new. It already has some scratches. Did you get hurt?
- No, thanks.
- That's the most important thing.
- **It's kind of you to say**. I feel a little stupid.
- **Forget about it**.
- When you lent me the bike it looked brand-new almost, anyway.
- Maybe, bue really I've fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.
- **I appreciate that**. Thank you.
